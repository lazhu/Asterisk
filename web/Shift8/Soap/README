Shift8 SOAP Extension

Simple SOAP extension for the Shift8 library, which exposes all the methods over SOAP requests. The current implementation
is making use of the SOAP Persistent objects to preserve an open connection with the remote asterisk server. However it is
the application's responsibility to properly Ping the remote server so that the connection remains open.

The included WSDL is from the autodiscovered library using the Zend Framework. One could avoid using Zend_Soap and use directly
Soap functionality from PHP. (Zend_Soap_Server is pretty much a wrapper over SoapServer)

Prerequisites
-------------

* An asterisk server (duh)
* Shift8
* Zend_Soap from Zend Framework version > 1.9 (http://framework.zend.com)

Installation
------------

Copy the contents of this folder to a directory under a PHP enabled apache server. In the index.php one should edit the configuration
options to match it's system.

Known Issues
------------

Currently, Shift8_Event is not properly exposed over SOAP. Variable $variables is declared public so as to be able to send it over 
SOAP. I am guessing I should modify the WSDL file on my own. (Anyone willing to help out, please do so!)
